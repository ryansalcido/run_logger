# Run Logger

https://rmsdevelopmentprojects.com/run-logger

A web application used to:
- view your Strava profile and running activities at a glance
- determine pace, time, and distance when given two of the variables

Built with React, Express.js, Node.js, Material UI, Strava Passport, and Babel.

Deployed on DigitalOcean with NGINX and PM2.


# Goal

The goal of this project was to integrate Passport with React to allow users to authenticate
via Strava and display an overview of their profile and activities. Additionally, create a
pace calculator which computes pace, time, and distance when given two of the variables.
